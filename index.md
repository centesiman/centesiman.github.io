Hi!! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiastic and in this blog I will regularly public my advances in this field. Mainly, we will be focusing on learning new techniques and tools commonly used in penetretion testing.

In addition, I will be posting write-ups of machines from platforms such as HackTheBox. The intention is to not only show how the machines can be resolved, but also try to underestand why there is a vulnerability.

Finally, if I ever venture on getting a certification in this filed, I will post my journey and final review.

I hope you enjoy it!!
